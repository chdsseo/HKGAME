    	<h3>What are the percentages of revenue from arcade games and online games in January? Will online businesses be divided into mobile games and online games and will the licensing fee exceed 5%? What are the percentages of revenue from arcade games and online games this year? What are the reasons for changes in the percentage of revenue from each product? What is the reason for the decrease in arcade games?<a class="toggleOpen"><span></span></a></h3>
        <div class="definition textEditor">
Revenue from arcade games and online games accounted for 18% and 82% of the revenue in January, respectively. Online games are no longer distinguished by mobile games, and online games and licensing fees for Knights of Valour did not exceed 5%. The biggest market for arcade games used to be Mainland China. Competition in arcade games in China has become intense. We no longer have the overwhelming advantage we had in terms of overall business competition. Although the market is substantial, the competition has become intense. Therefore, only appropriate levels of revenue can be maintained in terms of overall business performance. The arcade and online revenue proportions in January can be used as a reference for future operations and there would be little deviation overall.        </div>
    </li><!--data--> 
    
    <li class="clearfix"><!--data-->
    	<h3>What are the future and present goals for games with more significant growth and higher levels of anticipation such as Alpha, fishing games, and Golden HoYeah? What is the current state for app games? What are the goals for the five major product lines this year?<a class="toggleOpen"><span></span></a></h3>
        <div class="definition textEditor">
Alpha Children’s card games account for a low proportion and we have the Hero of Robots 2 children’s card game this year which account for a low proportion. The app has been the main source of growth since Q4 last year.<br>
In terms of the rankings, the Company’s top five major apps in January were Golden HoYeah, Star 3 in 1, Mangan Dahen, Good Luck 777, and Ocean King. The expectations for each product line are ranked similarly with the highest expectations and chances of growth for those ranked on top and relatively lower growth for those ranked last.        </div>
    </li><!--data--> 
    
    <li class="clearfix"><!--data-->
    	<h3>Do you have overseas development plans for the five major apps?<a class="toggleOpen"><span></span></a></h3>
        <div class="definition textEditor">
The Company has continuously operated in its overseas market. However, overall business operations in the overseas market have been more difficult than we expected. However, we never give up on operations in other markets and we will continue to do our best. Despite our best effort, we have not seen results in Thailand and Malaysia.        </div>
    </li><!--data--> 
    
    <li class="clearfix"><!--data-->
    	<h3>Golden HoYeah has made up for the Fafafa contract termination. How will the Company continue to increase its revenue?<a class="toggleOpen"><span></span></a></h3>
        <div class="definition textEditor">
Golden HoYeah has achieved significant growth since November last year and it has approached the average value in 2016. Although the number of players is half of the number of Fafafa, the paid rate and average payment per person has been higher than that of Fafafa. Therefore, we have approached the average revenue with Fafafa despite losing half the players.        </div>
    </li><!--data--> 
    
    <li class="clearfix"><!--data-->
    	<h3>Was the growth of Golden HoYeah due to the introduction of the AI system? How does the Company calculate or share the AI system software expenses? Does the Company plan to introduce AI into Star 3 in 1 or Mangan in the future? How will you calculate the introduction expenses in the future? Will the expenses increase?<a class="toggleOpen"><span></span></a></h3>
        <div class="definition textEditor">
We have only begun preliminary use of AI and we mostly use it for labeling, multi-faceted labeling, and CRM maintenance and use them with precision on the sales platform. The introduction of AI is effective on certain levels. However, the most important thing is the implementation of follow-up strategies. Correct labeling in games facilitates the use of sales and compensation strategies which are the same when applied to other products when projects introduce strategies for players. The software expenses for introducing AI into app games is insignificant for the Company and does not affect the Company.        </div>
    </li><!--data--> 
    
    <li class="clearfix"><!--data-->
    	<h3>What are the difficulties of duplicating the successful business model of Golden HoYeah into other games? Is player analysis the most difficult part? Can the growth of Golden HoYeah be attributed to AI?<a class="toggleOpen"><span></span></a></h3>
        <div class="definition textEditor">
Each game has a different group of players and it is not that easy to quickly transfer the same concepts to other groups of players. The main purpose of AI is to analyze players with the aim of duplicating successful concepts to other groups. AI is only a small part of the process, and success cannot be totally attributed to AI. It only helps with analysis.        </div>

    	<h3>What is current state of the launch of the Knights of Valour in China? Is it still being developed?<a class="toggleOpen"><span></span></a></h3>
        <div class="definition textEditor">
Advertising for the Knights of Valour 2 has not officially begun in China and it will first be launched in Taiwan. We mainly operate IP licensing for the first generation of Knights of Valour in China.        </div>

Mobile games and online games now account for a higher proportion of games. No new games have been launched for Star 3 in 1, Golden HoYeah, Good Luck777, Mangan Dahen, and Ocean King, but these games have become platforms for many games. We add dozens of games to the platforms every year to increase the competitiveness and contents of the platforms, so that players do not get tired of playing and we seek to add more methods for operations. When it comes to increasing payments, the tools may be important, but we dedicate a lot of effort on customer relations and customer management to categorize players, analyze players’ behavior, and stimulate player’s consumption. In terms of the structure of current and past products, the difference is that revenue has become relatively stable after these platforms are established. In the past, we were required to develop other markets after we achieved a certain level of saturation in market sales. However, the successful development of the platform has helped us maintain relatively stable maintenance and growth, and it has greatly increased the Company’s projected future revenue, providing us with more confidence in the Company&#039;s future operations.        </div>

        <div class="definition textEditor">
The overall arcade game market did not decline. Instead, the Company has reduced its efforts because of fierce competition. The Company chooses product lines in which it is competitive for operations. In addition, as sales of major products scheduled for the postponed to launch in June and July this year, also as arcade games generally perform better in the second half of the year compared to the first half, arcade game machines will have better performance in the second half of the year.<br>
Revenue from arcade games in the first half of the year declined by more than NT$60 million compared to last year. However, overall sales of arcade game machine in July amounted to more than NT$130 million. Therefore, the sales volume in July alone could make up for overall deficiencies in arcade game machines in the first half of the year. However, July has always been a busy month for arcade game machine shipments, and many shipments of important product lines are in the second half of the year. As a result, July should be considered as a peak. However, changes in the future would be determined by market response which would be an important factor for determining whether large-scale shipments can be achieved in the second half of the year. We cannot determine whether there can be major breakthroughs in the second half of the year. However, as major products are scheduled for launch in the second half of the year, we expect to achieve higher shipments for these products in the second half of the year.        </div>

    	<h3>Due to outstanding performance in revenue in the past few months, can you analyze the contribution of the five major mobile game product lines to revenue, their future prospects, and the current paid rate?<a class="toggleOpen"><span></span></a></h3>
        <div class="definition textEditor">
We will provide a brief analysis for the five major product lines.<br>
We have set a goal to achieve 3% paid rate for Golden HoYeah, and we had achieved this rate on individual days. However, the daily average payment rate may be lower. Markets are bigger for certain app categories such as Golden HoYeah which targets the international market. Some products are focused on the market in Taiwan such as Star 3 in 1, Good Luck777, and Mangan Dahen. Fishing games target the market in China. Therefore, Golden HoYeah has achieved higher growth in terms of DAU, paid rate, and ARPU because it has a bigger market. In addition, as the team has conducted more research on paid rates, the Company has achieved faster growth for apps in the past few months due to positive competition between the teams. These measures have been effective.<br>
The Company&rsquo;s revenue from the five major apps are as follows: Golden HoYeah still ranks first; Star 3 in 1 still ranks second; Mangan Dahen and Good Luck777 compete for the third place; and Ocean King ranks fifth. The Company currently experiences rapid growth from &ldquo;Golden HoYeah&rdquo; among the five product lines. Revenue from July has doubled and the source of income accounts for a high proportion of Golden HoYeah. &ldquo;Star 3 in 1&rdquo; has achieved more stable growth and it has little room for explosive growth. It has continuously grown each month. The game with weaker growth this year is &ldquo;Mangan Dahen&rdquo; which has been maintained at the same level since the beginning of this year. &ldquo;Good Luck777&rdquo; started with a lower baseline at the beginning of the year and has grown approximately 150%. &ldquo;Ocean King&rdquo; also started with a lower baseline and has grown by 50% to 100%. Therefore, all five product lines have achieved growth and contributed to overall business performance.        </div>

    	<h3>Has AI been adopted in games other than Golden HoYeah?<a class="toggleOpen"><span></span></a></h3>
        <div class="definition textEditor">
AI has been preliminarily adopted for Star 3 in 1. AI has generated a huge buzz in recent years, and it is almost regarded as a cure for everything. In fact, we really don’t have to pay attention to whether it has such special powers because AI helps us analyze player’s behavior; the key is whether data after the analysis can be used by the Company. Therefore, we should not be misguided into believing that AI would generate exponential growth and rapid revenue. It is not that easy. AI helps us make decisions for markets and players; the key is how we implement AI in projects.        </div>

    	<h3>What are the operating strategies for the five major product lines in the future? As Golden HoYeah targets the international market, which markets will the Company pursue in the future? Will there be new markets? Mangan Dahen&#039;s performance this year has remained the same. Does the Company have a strategy to spur growth? Why did Good Luck777 grow so much this year?<a class="toggleOpen"><span></span></a></h3>
        <div class="definition textEditor">
Golden HoYeah&#039;s markets are ranked as follows: China, Taiwan, United States, Japan, and Malaysia. In addition, Golden HoYeah’s team has accumulated more experience in team work, data analysis, and AI introduction than other teams in the Company. The leader&#039;s example will be used as reference for other projects to help the newer teams grow. Good Luck777 has achieved relatively good retention rates due to positive internal competition and the introduction of major machines which are the reasons for Good Luck777’s continuous growth. Ocean King has achieved continuous growth in the market in China in the past few months and we have high expectations for it.<br>
As marketing and promotion budgets have been planned for Star 3 in 1 each year, our next strategy will focus on celebrity endorsements. Due to the introduction of data analytics, we will continue to think of ways to improve the paid rate as well as seek ways to retain more existing players in response to the loss of players. We will also add multiple new games in the Star 3 in 1 all-in-one platform to satisfy the requirements of players in Taiwan. In addition, as Mahjong and chess games are quite popular in the Chinese-speaking area, we hope to have the opportunity to go beyond Taiwan and enter the market in China. Mangan Dahen had entered the Taiwanese market before Good Luck777. The original operating philosophy, data analysis, and business model are currently being adjusted. We plan to introduce related technologies and applications to help with the payment and retention rate. As for other new product lines, we will continue to launch new games in two-month cycles, improve the contents and scale of the platform. Products such as Mangan Dahen have the opportunity to enter foreign markets and we are actively developing these products for launch in the Southeast Asian market.<br>
We have high expectations for all product lines and we hope to achieve growth each month. All teams of the Company are doing their best to maximize the performance where as they focus on two elements: the first is how to make a product better and the second is finding a bigger market to explore. These measures will continue to be adopted by the Company, but we cannot guarantee that revenue will increase once we’ve optimized products and entered other markets. Nobody can be sure of this but we will keep doing our best. The process of growth starts with a low baseline with bigger room for continuous growth. However, once growth has passed a certain threshold, it is difficult to continue growth at the same pace. We hope to continue growth but we cannot predict the timing for the slowdown and decline of a product. If you have observed the Company’s revenue, you will see that it grew in March, dropped slightly in April, and continued to grow from May to July. However, we cannot guarantee that it would still go up in August because its baseline is already quite high. It may decline in August but we hope it will go up again in September. That’s the way the Company’s growth curve may be.        </div>

Nothing is limited. The question is whether you can achieve breakthroughs with your product. The answer to this question is also determined by two important factors. The first is whether the product is competitive and the second is whether it can break into other markets. There is no real upper limit. According to information provided by the General Manager Mr. Chiang, the Company only has approximately 1% of the market share in related apps so there is the other 99% we can target.

        <div class="definition textEditor">
Our team has actually considered this issue. Star 3 in 1 is a local Mahjong game which employs Mahjong rules unique to Taiwan. We have worked with Tencent in China in the past, but we did not succeed because of the incompatibility of the use of 13 tiles or 16 tiles in Mahjong. Our product could not be integrated into Mainland Chinese culture. However, the team has not given up. I believe that different regions have similar rules for related chess games and we can perhaps continue to try different things. We can, for instance, show ads in other regions and observe the effects, whether there are too many similar products or whether we can localize and adjust products to enter the markets. These are the teams&rsquo; current tasks.<br>
We have different things to consider for arrangements of the Company&rsquo;s internal product lines. For instance, Golden HoYeah&#39;s original game structure was designed to be a product internationally. Star 3 in 1 started in Taiwan and some aspects of the product have been more local. When we begin planning a product, we would determine the product&#39;s market. We would naturally think about whether we have the opportunity to expand to other countries.

        <div class="definition textEditor">
Xin Stars and 08 Online are successful because they had an early start. Games such as Golden HoYeah and Fafafa have no legal issues. Companies like Company A have studied the laws thoroughly and they understand what they cannot do. They would draw a line. Companies with Hondreds of millions in revenue do not cross these lines simply to get a larger piece of the market. They have very strict requirements in terms of legal compliance. As for Star 3 in 1, the game itself is very casual and people can pay to play for one whole month. They consume a lot of our bandwidth and more than 90% of them do not pay. The MAU is approximately 700,000 to 800,000. We only collected a little more than NT$20 million and it is not enough. We will think of ways to encourage non-paying players to pay a little to make the game more fun.        </div>

Aside from the poor performance in the Malaysian market, what are the reasons for declines in China and the United States? Have the adjustments in the arcade gaming venues opened in China in recent years come to a close or does the market need more time for adjustments? Will the arcade gaming venues set to open in shopping centers in the second half of the year open on schedule? What is the sales status of fishing games and skill games in the United States? Can they make up for the previous decline in AWP? (08/14/2018)<a class="toggleOpen"><span></span></a></h3>
        <div class="definition textEditor">
In China, the main factor was that we had sold more slot machines and ticket machines last year, but the inventory for these two types of machines has remained high this year. Therefore, we could not achieve the outstanding new orders as we did in the previous year. Due to the slowdown in the opening of new venues in tier 2 and tier 3 cities, we would indeed need time to observe market conditions. Fishing games are our mainstay in the United States and we have also faced excess inventory issues since the second quarter. Performance has also been poor when compared to the same period last year. We will develop new fishing games in the third quarter and launch them in the fourth quarter. As for skill games, we have yet to achieve a major breakthrough with our products.        </div>

        <div class="definition textEditor">
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the fourth quarter, even though October would appear to be the lowest point in the quarter, business will grow in November and December. Although the revenue in the fourth quarter may not reach standards in the third quarter, the Company&#39;s EPS has reached NT$9.82 as of the end of the third quarter. We intend to reach the annual revenue we attained in the previous year. In terms of the Company&#39;s current profitability structure, if our revenue can be close to the revenue of the previous year, the profitability may be better than the previous year.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;If we continue the operating structure, we expect stable growth in the next year.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We announced the termination of the contract with the Australian gambling company Aristocrat in the shareholder&#39;s meeting at the end of June. We estimated a reduction in revenue of NT$28 million each month and a reduction in profits of NT$7 million per month. It would be difficult for the profitability in the entire year to exceed levels in the previous year. However, under the leadership of the President Mr. Chen and with the hard work of the team, our performance has been better than expected.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of arcade games, we will continue to focus on the markets in China, Southeast Asia, and the United States. We will also launch new products such as VR and children&#39;s card games.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of online games, we renamed the &quot;Fafafa&quot; game developed in collaboration with Aristocrat to &quot;Golden HoYeah&quot; in August and maintained a line-up of more than 10 games. With revenue from the &quot;Star 3 in 1&quot; game platform and overseas royalties, we expect to achieve stable growth in overall revenue next year.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the performance of new products in the gaming industry must be tested by the market before conclusions can be drawn. The greatest risk associated with arcade games is the change of regulations in different countries. The uncertainty in revenue is high and investors should pay attention to the impact of these risks on revenue.<br>
